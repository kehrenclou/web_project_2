## Plan on improving the project

1. Change Contacts to About in Nav Menu (makes more sense).
2. Get and update Social Media Links and Practicum Home page links.
3. Add a floating up arrow to go back to begining of page or a go back button.
4. Disallow entering decimal numbers in form guests before hitting the submit button
5. having a confirmation pop up to display a message that reservation was received.

Add your ideas here :)
